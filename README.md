The first known mention of the game was in the 
book Wuzazu (zh) (simplified Chinese: 五杂俎; traditional Chinese: 五雜組) by the Chinese 
Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhi (谢肇淛; fl. ca. 1600), who wrote that the game dated back 
to the time of the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD).[6] In the book, the game was 
called **shoushiling** (手势令; lit "hand command"). Li Rihua's (李日华) book Note of Liuyanzhai (六砚斋笔记) 
also mentions this game, calling it shoushiling (手势令), huozhitou (豁指头), or huoquan (豁拳).
